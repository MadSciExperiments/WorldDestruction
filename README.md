# WorldDestruction
An experiment to see if a GitHub Repository can destroy the world!

I'm mad scientist and I am performing an experiment to see if a single GitHub repository is capable enough to destroy the world. It's just an experiment to draw conclusion with no hatred towards the world. If you have any plan to execute, don't hesitate to make a pull request.
